// are usually several. Those then compare equal, so the field reports true because an
// unrelated app is set to launch, and keeps reporting true after our own entry is
// removed. Left unquoted it even returns true for a path that does not exist on disk.
//
// The same truncation excludes our own correctly quoted entry from launchItems, since
// it parses to the full path and no longer matches the truncated lookup.

// Passing no path is not a way out: getLoginItemSettings then falls back to
// GetProcessExecPath(), which is unquoted and truncates identically.
